By adding 127.0.0.1 access is limited to localhost and access is only possible after nginx oder another web server is configured as reverse proxy.\r\n\r\nNote: Moving forward, anyone using docker-compose.production.yaml need to have something like Nginxto proxy the requests to the container.\r\n\r\nIf you want to verify whether the installation is working, try curl -I localhost:3000 to see if it returns 200. Also, you could temporarily drop the 127:0.0.1:3000:3000 for rails to 3000:3000 to access your instance at http://:3000. It's recommended to revert this change back and use Nginx in front.\r\n\r\nApproved-by: Vishnu Narayanan <vishnu@chatwoot.com>","sha":"1dfa173b3a4f25e4f5577354d5d7c14eb570a27a","orgName":"chatwoot","repoName":"chatwoot","createdAt":"2021-11-11T09:13:25Z"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
