# Contributors Page Template

This project iterates through your entire Github organization and builds a contributors page. Much like https://contributors.chatwoot.com. You can set up a contributors page for your organization quickly.

## ‚≠ê How it works

GitHub Actions is used to pull the commits and create the contributor database.

- Every 6 hours, a workflow fetches the latest commits from all the repositories and updates the contributor/commit data.
- This information is committed back to the repository.
- A leaderboard based on the commit history is created automatically.

Publishing the page is automated using Github Actions.

- Every time a commit is done on the `master` branch, the gh-pages workflow would run, and the branch `gh-pages` would be updated.

## üë©‚Äçüíª How to set up your own contributors page?

1. Create a repository from this template.
2. Update the `contributors.config.js` file in the repository as follows.

| Key                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| basePath           | If you are hosting the page on Github pages without a custom domain, you would need to configure this to the name of your repository. eg: '/contributors-page'                                      |
| projectName        | This can be your brand name, project name etc.                                                                                                                                                      |
| siteMetadata.title | This title field is used as the title in the generated webpage                                                                                                                                      |
| pageTitle          | Share the title to be shown on the page. eg: 'We thank all our contributors'                                                                                                                        |
| pageDescription    | Along with the title, you can use the description if you want to show gratitude to the community. e.g., Chatwoot would not have been what it is today without the help of our amazing contributors. |

| sponsorsLink       | If you have a Github sponsor/other sponsor pages, you can link here                                                                                                                                 |
